# Big things come in small packages - Tips and tricks for your own R package

📍 CorrelCon 2021

## About the talk

R is a great resource for data management, statistics, analysis, and visualization — and it becomes better every day. This is to a large part because of the active community that continuously creates and builds extensions for the R world. Dur- ing the talk, I will provide you with tips and tricks for contributing to this world by writing packages. If you want to get a quick introduction before the talk, [here is a hands-on tutorial](https://www.mzes.uni-mannheim.de/socialsciencedatalab/article/r-package/) on how to write your first R package.
